## Employee Directory

This app accesses Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) using AJAX to grab information for 12 random “employees”, then creates a directory based on that data. The 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. 

Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address. This is a searchable directory that also allows you to switch back and forth between employees within the modal.

There are no installed dependencies in this project, simply download and run the ```index.html```. Enjoy!
